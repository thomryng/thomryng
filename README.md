3. Even a poor plan is better than no plan at all. (Mikhail Chigorin)
4. A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week. (George S. Patton)
5. No plan survives first contact with the enemy. (Helmuth von Moltke the Elder)
6. Make a game plan and stick to it. Unless it’s not working. (Yogi Berra)
7. The plan is nothing; planning is everything. (attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower)
