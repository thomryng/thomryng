# The Plan

1. A goal without a plan is just a wish. _(Antoine de Saint-Exupéry)_
2. Plan for what is difficult while it is easy; do what is great while it is small. _(Sun Tzu)_
3. Even a poor plan is better than no plan at all. _(Mikhail Chigorin)_
4. A good plan violently executed now is better than a perfect plan executed next week. _(George S. Patton)_
5. No plan survives first contact with the enemy. _(Helmuth von Moltke the Elder)_
6. Make a game plan and stick to it. Unless it’s not working. _(Yogi Berra)_
7. The plan is nothing; planning is everything. _(attributed to Dwight D. Eisenhower)_
