This is a hack at the schedule for our 2024 Camino. This is a total of 63 days walking, to which at least three rest days will be added (Cahors and Burgos, plus one floating day).

A buffer of several days is built in at the end to account for unexpected Zero days due to fatigue or injury or someplace so spectacular we need to spend a day exploring it.

There are few notes for the Spanish section, as we've walked that before and have a vague idea of what to expect. 

Place names in CAPITALS have a population of more than 2500. \* following indicates a population of more than 10,000.

| 2 | Thu, Apr 04, 2024 | Saint-Privat-d'Allier | Saugues | 19.0 | 882 | 787 | Velay / Margeride | One of the most challenging stages of the whole walk.

| 3 | Fri, Apr 05, 2024 | Saugues | Domaine du Sauvage | 19.5 | 719 | 396 | Margeride | A whole lotta uphill. Domaine du Sauvage is a farm complex in the middle of nowhere and MUST be reserved (demi-pension). [http://www.sauvage-en-gevaudan.com/](http://www.sauvage-en-gevaudan.com/) |

### Additional Options at FIGEAC 

There are two major options/different routes that begin on stage 13, the **Célé Valley** and **Rocamadour** variants. The Célé Valley variant provides an alternate route to CAHORS of 5 days, while the Rocamadour variant takes 6 days to reach CAHORS. Given time constraints, it's unlikely that I will take either, although I'm somewhat disappointed to miss the great shrine at Rocamadour. 

One possibility is to take a train from FIGEAC to Rocamadour in the morning, and then back in the evening. That possibility will offset the remainder of the Camino by a day.
