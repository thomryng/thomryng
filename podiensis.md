This is a hack at the schedule for my 2023 Camino. This is a total of 63 days walking, to which at least three rest days will be added (Burgos for sure). 

A buffer of several days is built in at the end to account for unexpected Zero days due to fatigue or injury or someplace so spectacular we need to spend a day exploring it.

There are few notes for the Spanish section, as we've walked that before and have a vague idea of what to expect. 

Place names in CAPITALS have a population of more than 2500. \* following indicates a population of more than 10,000.
